In ImageViewer.jpeg, do not hardcode the images, but allow the user to select a folder, website, database. See 
what we did with the MP3Player (the iterator pattern for different data sources and image formats). You might 
consider some of the creational patterns in this regard as well.

I do not see Srdjan's part of the code nor his commits.

Most of the classes Isabella is in charge are stub, that is, merely place holders.

The code smells are more organisational. In other words, to fix the code high-level interventions are needed, i.e., 
design patterns.

Altogether, you started well with the project, but a lot of it is still missing. You need to make a final push to 
complete the project adequately and on time.
